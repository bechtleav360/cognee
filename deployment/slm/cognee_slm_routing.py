"""Route cognee's entity extraction to a per-entity-type LoRA adapter served by
LoRAX/vLLM on the T4.

Scaffold only -- see the design doc at
../../docs/superpowers/specs/slm-lora-adapters-design.md, and the
cognee-integration phase of ../../docs/superpowers/plans/slm-lora-adapters-plan.md.

Mechanism: cognee resolves LLM settings through the `llm_config` ContextVar
(see cognee/infrastructure/llm/config.py:get_llm_context_config). Any LLM call
made inside an async context where that ContextVar is set uses those settings.
Entity extraction is NOT wrapped in a pipeline_stage, so we set the ContextVar
directly around the call.

Each adapter is selected by putting its name in `llm_model` -- the custom/openai
provider passes that straight through as the OpenAI `model` field, which is how
both LoRAX and vLLM pick the adapter.

# Notes:
#  - Keep heavy tasks (graph extraction, completion) OFF this context -- they stay
#    on the big model. Only wrap the narrow, structured entity-extraction calls.
#  - Set STRUCTURED_OUTPUT_FRAMEWORK=litellm_native (JSON fallback + self-correct)
#    rather than the default instructor, since local models trip instructor's
#    schema/tool-call modes (see ollama/generic adapters).
#  - Better long-term: close the routing gap in the cognee-integration phase so entity extraction is
#    wrapped in its own pipeline_stage and driven by llm_<stage>_* env vars
#    instead of this manual ContextVar wrapper.
